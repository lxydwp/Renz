        <h3>Golden Retriever</h3>
        <p>The first major breeder was Dudley Marjoribanks, the Baron of Tweedmouth, who created the golden retriever in the 19th century by crossing a yellow retriever with the now-extinct tweed water spaniel, plus a mix of the bloodhound and Irish Setter. </p>

            <h3>irish Setter</h3>
            <p>Irish setters are energetic, rambunctious dogs with a sweet temperament. They’re a favorite family dog because of their loyalty and fun-loving nature. These dogs have been around for hundreds of years. In Ireland in the 1800s, they were used as companions on hunting trips to track down birds in a field and other prey throughout the countryside. Their excellent sense of smell, persistence and incredible speed has earned them a reputation as a superb hunting dog. Irish Setters are members of the sporting group of dogs.</p>

        <h3>Boston Terrier</h3>
        <p>In the 1870s English Bulldogs and English White Terriers (now extinct) were crossbred, making a dog known as a Hooper’s Judge. In the years following, these dogs were crossbred with English Bull Terriers, Pit Bull Terrier, Boxers, and French Bulldogs. This crossbreeding gave us the animal we now know as the Boston Terrier.</p>
